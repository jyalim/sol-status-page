Scrapes SLURM via `sinfo` and plots node status with `plotly`.  See the
rest of our public Sol stack and information about the Sol supercomputer
by visiting our official [Sol github repository][sol-repo].

On Sol's `admin.sol.rc.asu.edu`, the user `software` runs the generating shell
and python scripts via `crontab`:

    * * * * * /packages/public/sol-node-status/get-sol-node-status.sh &> /packages/public/sol-node-status/crontab.diag

Live on Open OnDemand page ([Sol status][sol-status], for ASU users); a
demonstration (of a system snapshot) is available 
[here, on my personal website][example].

A script to recreate the python environment with `mamba`/`conda` is
provided: `python-env.sh`. The status page really depends on `pandas`,
`numpy`, and `plotly`, but the general python environment for scientific
computing is provided.

Shell script will only save every tenth `zstd -19` compressed comma-separated
value (csv) files (every ten minutes). This is determined by an incremented
counter that is stored in `snapshot/.snapshot_modulo.do.not.delete`. When there
are errors the `zstd` file will not be generated and csvs will not be
removed. This is to help determine what occurred in the data and catch
all edge cases.

The final html page is made available to the OOD nodes through Salt
symbolically linking the html file:

    admin:/srv/salt/sol/states/cluster/ood/apps/status/status.sls
        /packages/public/sol-node-status/sol.html ->
        ood*:/var/www/ood/public

and provisioning the content as shown in the `provisioning/` directory.
The main change to the status application was to include the status html
page as an iframe (with an associated legend).

Debugging
---------

Diagnose issues from diagnostics file generated by cron:

    /packages/public/sol-node-status/crontab.diag

and from Python runtime:

    /packages/public/sol-node-status/crontab.diag.log

Note: `crontab.diag` is non-empty upon successful execution with normal
diagnostic statistics on the plotly figure, i.e., 

    len :: total number of nodes being visualized
      M :: number of nodes in figure's horizontal direction
      N :: number of nodes in figure's vertical direction
      w :: figure width in pixels
      h :: figure height in pixels

Planned
-------

* Implement via JS in kibana.
* Automate monthly archiving of snapshot data.
